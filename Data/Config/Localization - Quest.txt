Approach this Mod from a fresh perspective or you will surely be eaten by the horde or surcome to the elements. You will now step into the life of one of the few humans left alive after the outbreak. Humanity will live or die upon your struggle. Prepare to experience the meaning of TRUE SURVIVAL.\n\nDie well my friend.\n\nSpider",,,,

quest_BasicSurvival1,,,,Choose your Profession,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival1_subtitle,,,,Choose your Profession,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival1_description,,,,"Locate your Start Here item in your Tool Belt. Enter your crafting menu and click on the Start Here item then click Recipes. Now to the left you will see the list of Professions you have to choose from. Select one and click Craft. Once you have crafted your Profession Case put it in your hand and place it on the ground. Now you can use your Key to open the Profession Case and loot and learn your skills.(If you lose your key you can punch the Profession Case also).",,,,
quest_BasicSurvival9,,,,Craft Fiber Ropes,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival9_subtitle,,,,Craft Fiber Ropes,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival9_description,,,,"This is your Survival 101 training. Learn quick and learn good for your life will depend on it. First lesson: Everything you see in this world, and by everything we mean everything, can be destroyed, rebuilt, and probably be used as a tool. For starters let's make some fiber ropes. Use your bare hands to collect some grass from your surrounding and then craft some fiber ropes in your inventory.",,,,
quest_BasicSurvival2,,,,Craft a stone axe,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival2_subtitle,,,,Craft a stone axe,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival2_description,,,,"Now that we have some fiber ropes we can make one of the most primitive tools known since the dawn of man: a stone axe. Collect some small stones either from the ground or by destroying Boulders. It may take a long time without tools. Then we need some sticks, which can be found by breaking bushes, trees and chairs. Apart from the Stone Axe there are many more advanced tools but for now the stone axe will have to do. When you have it try the boulder and tree again with the axe.",,,,
quest_BasicSurvival3,,,,Craft primitive clothing,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival3_subtitle,,,,Craft primitive clothing,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival3_description,,,,"You are subject to weather conditions, and depending on where you are this will affect you more or less. The dessert is a hot place and you should wear some clothing that will reduce your temperature such as a hat and a bandana. When you are in a snowy area or cold area you want to put on as many clothes as you can get your hands on. So let's prepare for that with some makeshift clothes. Later on you will find better clothing which you can use as blueprint to make your own.",,,,
quest_BasicSurvival4,,,,Craft Wooden Club,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival4_subtitle,,,,Craft Wooden Club,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival4_description,,,,"Going toe to toe with zombies is bad enough. It's even worse when you don't even have a weapon. So let's make at least some sort of club. Collect some sticks to do so. Melee with zombies should be avoided if possible but sometimes it can't be helped. You better be prepared. Melee weapons are better in melee than distance weapons or tools (and a stone axe is not a weapon). Using a weapon will reduce its durability until it breaks. Make sure to repair it before that happens or have a spare weapon handy.",,,,
quest_BasicSurvival5,,,,Craft Bow & Arrows,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival5_subtitle,,,,Craft Bow & Arrows,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival5_description,,,,"Never bring a knife to a gunfight. Never go melee with a zombie. And to keep it this way we will construct a primitive bow and arrows. There are many ways to craft arrows but sometimes the easiest is to find some small stones, sticks and feathers. Feathers can usually be found in bird's nests on the ground. They are not necessarily abundant and sometimes hard to find in the grassland or woods but there should be enough of them to provide you with resources for your ammunition. Also remember, using a bow will decrease its durability. Keep an eye out for that.",,,,
quest_BasicSurvival6,,,,Let's kill something,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival6_subtitle,,,,Let's kill something,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival6_description,,,,"Okay, let's kill something. Find a zombie, swing that big wooden club and smash its head. You are free to hit any other body parts but if you want to kill it for good, hit the head. It may take some practice and more than one swing. Once you killed it, loot it, and you can destroy the remains with your stones axe if you want to.",,,,
quest_BasicSurvival7,,,,Craft cloth fragments,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival7_subtitle,,,,Craft cloth fragments,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival7_description,,,,"Cloth fragments are a common resource used in many tools and items. You can find cloth fragments when you tear down old couches, curtains or mattresses, or by collecting cotton (the white plants) with your hands and making cloth fragments yourself. Collect 95 pieces of Cotton and craft some cloth.",,,,
quest_BasicSurvival8,,,,Craft bandages,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival8_subtitle,,,,Craft bandages,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival8_description,,,,"Did we already mention you should not have melee fights with zombies? At certain times it can't be avoided though because they outrun you or surprise you or cornered you. If a group of braindead was actually able to corner you, you may have other problems... but anyway... in those cases you might get hit and be bleeding, you lose health constantly while you are bleeding so use bandages to stop it. Also keep them handy at all times, maybe even in your belt.",,,,
quest_BasicSurvival10,,,,Craft Bed Roll,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival10_subtitle,,,,Craft Bed Roll,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival10_description,,,,"Crafting a bedroll from cloth fragments gives you a place to sleep and (more importantly) to respawn should you die. Without a bedroll you will respawn randomly in this world, probably hours away from where your friends are and your bag pack dropped with all your items. Place bedroll and you can respawn at a fixed position. Also make sure it doesn't get destroyed or taken. You can place more than one bedroll but only the last one placed will count as respawn point.",,,,
quest_BasicSurvival11,,,,Craft Campfire,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival11_subtitle,,,,Craft Campfire,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival11_description,,,,"Building a campfire will provide you with 5 things: heat, in case you are cold (actually, even when not, the fire doesn't care if you are hot or cold), it will supply you with light during the night, you can cook food if you have the proper cooking equipment, you can boil water which is an ingredient in many recipes, and if you keep the fire on long enough, it will supply you with a stream of zombies which are attracted by the activity. Those are the facts of life.",,,,
quest_BasicSurvival12,,,,Craft Stone Shovel,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival12_subtitle,,,,Craft Stone Shovel,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival12_description,,,,"Another tool. The Stone Shovel is not as versatile as the axe and certainly not used that often but better at digging dirt and sand than the axe. Again, using it will reduce its durability, so keep an eye out for that and repair the shovel when necessary or have another handy.",,,,
quest_BasicSurvival13,,,,Craft a Bone Shiv,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival13_subtitle,,,,Craft a Bone Shiv,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival13_description,,,,"There's more than one way to skin a cat…or bear, or dog, or rabbit, or deer, or pig, or chicken. And using the stone axe isn't one of them. Well, actually you can do it but it yields not as much resources as if you were to do it with the proper tool like a knife or a bone shiv. In order to be able to craft a bone shiv in your inventory you need a Femur bone which can be found on dead bodies of zombies. Just hit them with your stone axe until you get a Femur bone. Bone shivs can also be used as weapons but they are not that effective.",,,,
quest_BasicSurvival14,,,,Clean some water,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival14_subtitle,,,,Clean some water,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival14_description,,,,"Water is vital. Water is life. There's not much clean water left and if you don't drink, you will die. The easiest way to get water is find some cans and boil the water with a stick on a campfire. Of course you can also drink unclean water but it will probably give you diarrhea.",,,,
quest_BasicSurvival15,,,,Craft Iron Reinforced Club,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival15_subtitle,,,,Craft Iron Reinforced Club,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival15_description,,,,"Okay, it's time to improve. So far the wooden club was useful, but there's a way to make it even better. Use scrap metal and attach it to your wooden club. Why? Because it hurts more.",,,,
quest_BasicSurvival16,,,,Making Food Servings,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival16_subtitle,,,,Making Food Servings,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival16_description,,,,"You need to eat. If you don't you will starve and die. That's the facts of life. Find some food. Basic raw foods can be scraped into servings and used to cook more nutritious meals. Make some food servings to get the hang of it. Be on the lookout for wild growing foods like Blue Berries, Potato’s, Apples and Carrots.",,,,
quest_BasicSurvival17,,,,Craft a torch,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival17_subtitle,,,,Craft a torch,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival17_description,,,,"It gets dark at night. There are several ways to light your place. The easiest is a torch. You may already carry one but it's time to make another one and hang it on a wall. Find some coal and a stick and there's your torch. If you place it on a wall, it will consume combustible materials and warm you if you are close. If it runs out of materials to burn the light will go out. (side note: apparently torches put a strain on your computer's GPU resources, so don't use too many or your frame rate will drop. Use candles and other lights instead.)",,,,
quest_BasicSurvival18,,,,Craft a splint,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival18_subtitle,,,,Craft a splint,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival18_description,,,,"Sometimes you may fall too far because you had no slipped or because you were cornered (again, don't get cornered by a braindead mob). Or you got too close to that crawling pest and now your leg is sprained or broken, which will severely impair your movement. A splint will help you heal faster. It's not perfect but better than nothing. Oh, and a splint doesn't mean your leg is immune to further damage. A sprained leg even when splinted will break easier, and a broken leg may result in a second broken leg which doesn't necessarily help your situation.",,,,
quest_BasicSurvival19,,,,Craft PLACE and UPGRADE spikes,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival19_subtitle,,,,Craft PLACE and UPGRADE spikes,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival19_description,,,,"Let's get serious with pest control. You can't watch your back all the time and neither can you watch your little hideout all the time. You need a passive defense. Spikes will do that for you. They are easily crafted using sticks. They will do a little damage but will trap the Zombies making them easier for you to kill. Get going and find some sticks. Then craft 10 Wooden Spikes and place them then upgrade them with a stoneaxe using sticks to finish them.",,,,
quest_BasicSurvival20,,,,Craft hay bales,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival20_subtitle,,,,Craft hay bales,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival20_description,,,,"Why on earth would I need a hay bale you might ask. One hit from a zombie and the hay bale is gone. And you're right. It just takes one hit. But then again, it's a hay bale not a wall of steel. Hay bales can server other purposes. They are cheap steps very early if there's something above you which you can't reach (like a window or rooftop). They provide cover, which is good. Zombies that don't see you don't attack you. And last but not least you can fall from any height on a hay bale and be fine. Now isn't that something? Go get some.",,,,
quest_BasicSurvival21,,,,Cure and Dry Leather,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival21_subtitle,,,,Cure and Dry Leather,,,,
quest_BasicSurvival21_description,,,,"All survivors need to know how to cure and dry leather so that will be your next task. Kill an animal and use a knife or shiv to harvest Animal Hides and Brain Matter from its body then find some Lumps of Coal. IF you needed to build a forge you could use these hides to craft a Bellows but for now let’s cure some. On the Campfire with a pot cook the Animal Hide, Brain Matter and Coal to create Cured Leather. Once you have the Cured Leather you can Dry it on a Drying Rack or bind 4 together with sticks by crafting "ToDryLeather" then place them above ground in the sunlight and wait for them to dry.",,,,

A Power Swing has a longer delay between swings and uses more stamina but it receives much higher head damage, a slight overall damage increase and a better chance to apply any debuffs like bleeds or crits.\n\n2)On many one handed melee weapons you can use the alt attack to fight off the zombies. Doing this gives you a slight speed burst and stops zombies from grabbing you or biting you.",,,,

airDropTip,,Popup Tip,KeyTrunk FrNone GrNone KgNone SpNone,"True Survival Mod Notes\n\n1)Because of the large amount of added recipes the search for recipe by text function is very laggy. To avoid this favorite recipes you use often and then use the favorites tab or click on a item in the recipe you are looking for and click the recipes button. Both of these methods do not suffer from any lag.\n\n2)The stats displayed in the weapon information screen do not take into account material bonuses so are not correct. Different tools and weapo0ns will react differently to different materials so experiment with each to see what they are good at.\n\n3)True Survival relies on the scraping function for many things.

You will have to eat a balanced diet of protein combined with fruits, veggies and grains to maintain a good diet. Though many prepared foods may have some nutrition the most efficient way to maintain your diet is to scrap base raw foods into servings then cook recipes with them ideally on the Food Prep Table. Once you have a good diet you will feel the benefits of healthy eating in many ways such as healing faster from injury’s, gaining health and wellness from foods, moving faster and many more. The longer you go without maintaining a good diet the more malnourished you will become. When malnourished some of the negative effects are you cannot gain health or wellness from foods, you take longer to heal from injuries, move slower and many more. Many things scrap to food servings even some can foods, scrap them all to learn what each makes.\n\n2) Workstations that burn fuel can attract zombies.",,,,
